## Tips for Linux

If you are on Linux, and want to use one of the launchers that is not available natively, I suggest you use Lutris and make sure that the BoilR integration for Lutris is enabled (it is by default, see config section). 
If you want to avoid launching into Lutris, here are a few ways that you can do that.

### GOG
I recommend you just use Heroic. But if you really, really want to use GOG Galaxy you can:

- Install [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- Install GOG from Lutris [here](https://lutris.net/games/gog-galaxy/)
- Set the path to GOG in the config.toml (or through the UI)
- Run BoilR
- Remember to pick which version of Proton you want to use for a game, before the first time you play it.

### Epic

I recommend you just use Heroic, Rare, or [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary). But if you really, really want to use EGS you can:

- Install [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- Install EGS from Lutris [here](https://lutris.net/games/epic-games-store/)
- Set the path to EGS in the config.toml (or through the UI)
- Run BoilR
- Remember to pick which version of Proton you want to use for a game, before the first time you play it.

### Origin

- Download the Origin installer
- Run the installer by adding it to Steam via the "add a non-Steam game" option
- Remember to set "compatibility" to a newer Proton version
- After the install, BoilR can find and add the games
- Validate that the found games have the correct Proton version
