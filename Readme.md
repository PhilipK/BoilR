# BoilR

## Description

BoilR automatically adds (almost) all your games to your Steam library.

It uses the Steam 3rd party shortcuts feature and does not require you to set up anything.
The goal is that you do not have to leave your Steam library to launch games from other launchers/stores, so that you can find all the games that you have available.
Optionally you can set BoilR up to automatically download artwork from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/).

## Tips for steam deck

I currently don't have a steam deck, which slows down development for it a bit.
There might still be problems specific to the deck, so if you run into one please check the issues.

If you have a problem that a game wont launch, try to manually set a proton version for it.

## Tips for linux

If you are running linux and are running into problems check [tips for linux seciton](tips_for_linux.md)

## Configuration

Most people will not have to configure anything, just open BoilR and click Synchronize, but it is possible to configure a lot, see the [configuration section](configuration.md)
