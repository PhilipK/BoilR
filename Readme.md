# BoilR

BoilR automatically adds (almost) all your games to your Steam library (including image art).

![BoilR Screenshot](screenshot_1.png)

It uses the Steam 3rd party shortcuts feature and does not require you to set up anything.
The goal is that you do not have to leave your Steam library to launch games from other launchers/stores, so that you can find all the games that you have available.
Optionally, you can set up BoilR to automatically download artwork from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/).

## Getting started
- Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/PhilipK/BoilR/releases).
- Run the executable. 
    - if you are on a Steam Deck, right click and mark it "executable" under properties
- Click Import Games.
- Restart Steam to see your new shortcuts.

If you are on Linux (or a Steam Deck) you can install BoilR from [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.philipk.boilr).
Be aware that the flatpak version has some limitations compared to the native version.
There is also an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/steam-boilr-gui)

## Getting cover art for your shortcuts

- Get a [SteamGridDB API key](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api)
- Run BoilR
- Put the auth key in the input in the settings
- Click "Import games"


## Tips 

### Tips for Linux

If you are running Linux (this includes Steam Deck) and are running into problems check [tips for Linux section](tips_for_linux.md)

### Configuration

Most people will not have to configure anything, just open BoilR and click Import Games, but it is possible to configure a lot, see the [configuration section](configuration.md)

### Run as CLI

In previous releases there was both a CLI and UI version of BoilR, now there is only a UI version.
But you can add the commandline argument ``--no-ui`` and then the UI version will act like the old CLI version.
This saves some CO2 from not having to build 2 versions of BoilR for each platform, and it also makes development easier.

### Rename shortcuts

You can rename a shortcut from BoilR by double clicking it from the import list and picking a new name.
If you want to revert back to the original name, just clear the name and click rename.

## Contributions 

### How can I help/contribute?
If you are a coder, you are very welcome! You can fork this repo and then create a pull request.

To check formats and errors of code before run the code:

```shell
cargo fmt

cargo check
```

To run BoilR just write:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you are not a developer (or you don't like to code in Rust) do spread the work and create issues/discussions for anything.

### I found a bug, what do I do?
Check that there is not already an issue for it [here](https://github.com/PhilipK/BoilR/issues)
If not, create a new issue and I will have a look at it (remember to write which OS you are using).

### I have a great idea / I would like support for a specific platform, what do I do?
Check out the [discussions](https://github.com/PhilipK/BoilR/discussions) and feel free to create new discussions for your idea.


### Can I donate to support BoilR?
Nope, please don't, donate it to your favorite charity instead, and if you don't have one of those may I suggest something like [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/).
